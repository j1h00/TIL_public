# MySQL with Mosh 

## Inner Joins

```mysql
SELECT order_id, first_name, last_name

SELECT order_id, orders.customer_id, first_name, last_name

SELECT * 
FROM orders
JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id 
						-- prefix ambiguous column (duplicates with same name)
```

```mysql
SELECT order_id, o.customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM orders o 			-- abbreviation
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
```

```mysql
-- exercise
SELECT order_id, oi.product_id, name, quantity, oi.unit_price
FROM order_items oi 
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id= p.product_id
```

## Joining Across Databases

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM order_items oi
JOIN sql_inventory.products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
		-- table(products) from other database(sql_inventory) needs prefix
```

```mysql
USE sql_inventory; -- USE select current database

SELECT * 
FROM sql_store.order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
```

## Self Joins

```mysql
USE sql_hr;
-- self join example for hierarchy generation
SELECT *
FROM employees e 
JOIN employees m 		-- when self join, need to use different alias
	ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
```

```mysql
USE sql_hr;

SELECT 
	e.employee_id,
	e.first_name,
	m.first_name AS manager 
FROM employees e 
JOIN employees m 
	ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
```

## Joining Multiple Tables (>2)

```mysql
USE sql_store;

SELECT 
	o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    os.name AS status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c 
	ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN order_statuses os
	ON o.status = os.order_status_id
```

```mysql
--exercise
USE sql_invoicing;

SELECT 
	p.payment_id,
    p.client_id,
    c.name,
    p.invoice_id,
    p.date,
    p.amount,
    pm.name
FROM payments p
JOIN clients c
	ON c.client_id = p.client_id
JOIN payment_methods pm
	ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
```

## Compound Join Conditions

- composite primary key  : primary key contains more than one column 

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM order_items oi
JOIN order_item_notes oin 
	ON oi.order_id = oin.order_id
    AND oi.product_id = oin.product_id			-- join with two column 
```

## Implicit Join Syntax

```mysql
-- explicit syntax
SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
	
-- implicit join syntax => not recommended, can cause cross joins..
-- 							when WHERE clause is accidently missing
SELECT * 
FROM orders o, customers c
WHERE o.customer_id = c.cusotmer_id
```

## Outer Joins

- INNER JOIN : only give rows with the right JOIN condition 
- OUTER JOIN : 
  - LEFT JOIN : returns all the records from the left table, whether JOIN condition is True or False
  - RIGHT JOIN : "" from the right table, ""

```mysql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o 					-- LEFT OUTER(optional) JOIN 
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id 

FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN customers c 
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id 
```

```mysql
-- exercise 
SELECT 
	p.product_id,
    p.name,
    oi.quantity
FROM products p 
LEFT JOIN order_items oi 
	ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
ORDER BY p.product_id
```

## Outer Join Between Multiple Tables

- avoid right join!!  possible with LEFT JOIN 

```mysql
SELECT 
	c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    o.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o 						-- LEFT OUTER JOIN
	ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN shippers sh						-- and INNER JOIN
	ON o.shipper_id = sh.shipper_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id 
```

```mysql
-- exercise 
SELECT 
	o.order_date,
    o.order_id,
    c.first_name AS customer,
    s.name AS shipper,
    os.name AS status
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shippers s
	ON o.shipper_id = s.shipper_id 
JOIN order_statuses os
	ON o.status = os.order_status_id
```

## Self Outer Join 

```mysql
USE sql_hr;

SELECT 
	e.employee_id,
    e.first_name,
    m.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m
	ON e.reports_to = m.employee_id
```

## USING

```mysql
use sql_store;

SELECT 
	o.order_id,
    c.first_name,
    sh.name AS shipper
FROM orders o 
JOIN customers c
	-- ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    USING (customer_id)	-- use only when both column names are exactly the same
LEFT JOIN shippers sh
	USING (shipper_id)
```

```mysql
SELECT *
FROM order_items oi
JOIN order_item_notes oin
	-- ON oi.order_id = oin.order_id
    -- AND oi.product_id = oin.product_id
    USING (order_id, product_id)	-- for composite primary key
```

```mysql
-- exercise
USE sql_invoicing;

SELECT 
	p.date,
    c.name AS client,
    p.amount,
    pm.name
FROM payments p
JOIN clients c
	USING (client_id)
JOIN payment_methods pm
	ON p.payment_method = pm.payment_method_id
```

## Natural Joins

- don't explicitly specify the column name 
- database engine join them based on the common columns.
- not recommended, counld bring unexpected results 

```mysql
SELECT 
	o.order_id,
    c.first_name
FROM orders o 
NATURAL JOIN customers c
```

## Cross Joins

- to combine or join every record from the first table, with every record in a second table

```mysql
-- implicit syntax
SELECT 
	c.first_name AS customer,
    p.name AS product
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN products p -- brings all the combination of customer and product 
ORDER BY c.first_name

-- explicit syntax
SELECT 
	c.first_name AS customer,
    p.name AS product
FROM customers c, orders o 
ORDER BY c.first_name
```
