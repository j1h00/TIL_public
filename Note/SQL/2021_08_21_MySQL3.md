# MySQL with Mosh 

## Unions

- combine rows, not columns

```mysql
SELECT 
	order_id,
    order_date,
    'Active' AS status
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2019-01-01'
UNION 							-- combine above and below rows
SELECT 
	order_id,
    order_date,
    'Archive' AS status			-- column num should be same with above
FROM orders
WHERE order_date < '2019-01-01'
```

```mysql
SELECT first_name			-- first query determine result column name 
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT name				
FROM shippers				-- could be a different table 
```

```mysql
-- exercise
SELECT customer_id, first_name, points, 'Bronze' AS type
FROM customers
WHERE points < 2000
UNION
SELECT customer_id, first_name, points, 'Silver' AS type
FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000
UNION
SELECT customer_id, first_name, points, 'Gold' AS type
FROM customers
WHERE points > 3000
```

## Column Attributes

- Column

- Datatype

  - INT
  - VARCHAR : variable character
  - CHAR : character (waste of space)

- PK : primary key

- NN : Not NULL. Check if NULL is not accepted. (Check if required)

- AI : Auto Increment, often used with PK. 

  â€‹	  when inserting new record, mysql increment column value automatically 

- Default / Expression 

## Inserting a Single Row 

```mysql
INSERT INTO customers
VALUES (
    DEFAULT, -- DEFAULT for customer_id AI
    'John',
    'Smith',
    '1990-01-01', -- birth_date is optional (NN not checked)
    NULL, -- or DEFAULT
    'address',
    'city'
    'CA',
    DEFAULT)
```

```mysql
-- can select wanted column and order
INSERT INTO customers (
	last_name,
    first_name, -- order can be changed
    birth_date, 
    address,
    city,
    state)
VALUES (
    'Smith',
    'John',
    '1990-01-01', 
    'address',
    'city'
    'CA')
```

## Inserting Multiple Rows

```mysql
INSERT INTO shippers (name)
VALUES 	('Shipper1'),
		('Shipper2'),
		('Shipper3')  -- add with paranthesis 
```

```my
-- exercise
INSERT INTO products (name, quantity_in_stock, unit_price)
VALUES 	('ChocoPie', 20, 3.00),
		('VegiMill', 30, 1.00),
		('Korean Beef', 5, 10.00)
```

## Inserting Hierarchical Rows

- orders and order_items
  -  actual order can have more than one order_items 
  - parent - child relationship
  - how to insert order and order_items? => insert data into multiple tables

```mysql
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, status)
VALUES (1, '2019-01-02', 1); -- need to insert valid custoner_id and valid status

-- built in functions LAST_INSERT_ID
INSERT INTO order_items
VALUES 
	(LAST_INSERT_ID(), 1, 1, 2.95),
	(LAST_INSERT_ID(), 2, 1, 3.95)
```

## Creating a Copy of a Table

- CREATE TABLE : ignore PK and AI column attributes

```mysql
CREATE TABLE orders_archive AS 
SELECT * FROM orders 
```

```mysql
INSERT INTO order_archived
SELECT * -- subquery starts
FROM orders
WHERE order_data < '2019'-01-01
```

```mysql
-- exercise
-- 1. create invoices_archive
-- 2. join clients table with invoices, client_name instead of client id, and use it for subquery 
-- 3. only invoices that do have a payment_date
USE sql_invoicing;

CREATE TABLE invoices_archived AS 
SELECT 
	i.invoice_id, 
    i.number, 
    c.name AS client, 
    i.invoice_total, 
    i.payment_total, 
    i.invoice_date, 
    i.due_date, 
    i.payment_date
FROM invoices i
JOIN clients c USING (client_id)
WHERE payment_date IS NOT NULL
```

## Updating a Single Row 

```mysql
UPDATE invoices
SET payment_total = 10, payment_date = '2019-03-01'
WHERE invoice_id = 1

SET payment_total = DEFAULT, payment_date = NULL

SET payment_total = invoice_total * 0.5, payment_date = due_date
```

## Updating Multiple Rows

- safe update mode in MySQL workbench => update only a single record

```mysql
UPDATE invoices
SET 
	payment_total = invoice_total * 0.5, 
	payment_date = due_date
WHERE client_id = 3 -- every item (with clientd_id = 3) is updated

WHERE client_id IN (3, 4)
```

```mysql
-- exercise
-- Write a SQL statement to give any customers born before 1990, 
-- 50 extra points
USE sql_store;

UPDATE customers
SET points = points + 50 
WHERE birth_date < '1990-01-01'
```
